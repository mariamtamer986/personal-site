# Personal Website

This is my first attempt at creating a fully responsive personal website using only HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The purpose of this project is to hone my front-end development skills before integrating logic with JavaScript.

## 🌟 About the Project
- The website serves as a brief introduction about me.
- It is fully responsive and designed to adapt to different screen sizes.
- There is zero integrated logic in this project, as I have yet to refine my JavaScript skills before adding interactivity.

## 🎨 Design
- The entire design was created by me using Canva.
- The link for my original Canva design, for reference, can be found [here](https://mariam-tamer-website.my.canva.site/). 

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling
- Bootstrap for responsiveness and ready templates

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Integrating JavaScript for interactivity.
- Enhancing animations and transitions for a smoother user experience.

This project is a small step in my learning journey, and I'm excited to keep improving and exploring more in web development! ✨
